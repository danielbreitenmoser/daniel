CNA = Copy number aberrations ; present in most cancer types and excert functional impact on development

CNV= Copy number variations

Progenetix is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource

CGH = Comparative Gemomic Hybridization

includes datasets from external resources like TCGA, cBioPortal, ArrayExpress, GEO

very little pre-processing is preferred in order to maximize qualitative homogeneity of the final CNA calls.

they apply their in house processing pipeline from the arrayMap prjoect

the current analysis workflow handles the processing of 13 Affymetrix SNP array platforms including 9 Genome wide arrays

variations in abundance of copy numbers have pathophysiological effects in cancer biology

the most prevalent copy number is treated as the baseline and the bigger the abberation, the bigger the effect

ASCN= Allele specific copy number variation

LOH= loss of heterozygosity

ASCN Potentiates new analysis: first, gives overview of germline variant landscape, second, allows detection of LOH events

copy number netural LOH can be commonly observed in hematological malignancies
